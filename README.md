# Self Reader

This program just `puts` its own source code to the terminal. The only function in the file `read_file` simply opens a file and `puts` it to the terminal. This is just called on ``` __FILE__ ```, which is how Ruby refers to the currently executing file.

## Usage

To run:

``` bash
ruby self_reader.rb
```
